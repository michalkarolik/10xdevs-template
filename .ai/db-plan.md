## 2. Relationships

- A **user** can have many **topics** (one-to-many)
- A **topic** belongs to one **user** (many-to-one)
- A **topic** can have many **flashcards** (one-to-many)
- A **flashcard** belongs to one **topic** (many-to-one)

## 3. Indexes

```sql
-- Create indexes for better query performance
CREATE INDEX idx_topics_user_id ON topics(user_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_flashcards_topic_id ON flashcards(topic_id);

```
